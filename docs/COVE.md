# Behaviour the cove fork promises to cove

This file lists the fork behaviour cove depends on. A change here is a change
to a contract: tell cove before it lands.

## SSO failure: `login_error` and `retry_after` on the caller's `next`

When an SSO login started with a `next` query parameter, a failure at the SSO
return (`/@warpgate/api/sso/return`) sends the browser back to that `next`
instead of to the `/@warpgate` login page.

Only a safe `next` qualifies: a site-relative path starting with a single `/`
(not `//`, not `/\`, not an absolute URL). The redirect goes to the origin the
SSO return URL named, so `next` can never carry the browser off-site.

### Parameters

| Parameter     | When                         | Value                                   |
|---------------|------------------------------|-----------------------------------------|
| `login_error` | every SSO failure            | one of the four codes below             |
| `retry_after` | only with `ip_blocked`       | integer seconds until the IP is unblocked |

`retry_after` is the time left on the client IP's login-protection block,
rounded down to whole seconds, and `0` if the block has just expired. It is
never sent with any other code.

### Codes

The set is exactly these four. A new code is a new contract.

| Code               | Meaning                                                                 |
|--------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `ip_blocked`       | Login protection rejected the credential because the client IP is blocked. |
| `sso_failed`       | Any other SSO validation failure: bad or missing state or code, unverified e-mail, a rejected credential. A locked account is reported as `sso_failed`, so an unproven caller learns nothing about lock status. |
| `no_matching_user` | SSO succeeded but no Warpgate user matches the identity.                |
| `access_denied`    | The user exists but is not allowed in (for example the user's allowed IP range excludes the client). |

Warpgate logs the real underlying reason server-side.

### Rules

- Any `login_error` or `retry_after` already present in `next` is removed
  before the new ones are appended, so the caller cannot forge either.
- The parameters are appended with `&` if `next` already has a query, else `?`,
  and always before a `#fragment`.
- Without a safe `next` (none given, or an unsafe one) nothing changes: the
  browser goes to the `/@warpgate` login page with a free-text `login_error`,
  and no `retry_after`.
- A failure before the SSO handshake is found (no `state`, no `code`, no active
  SSO process) has no `next` to return to and takes the fallback.
- An existing Warpgate session cookie may survive a failed retry. Treat a
  request that arrives with `login_error` as a failure whatever the session says.
